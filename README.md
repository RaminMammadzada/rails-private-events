# Microverse School > Rails > #6 Associations

In this project we built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and join other events. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like ‚ÄúAndy‚Äôs House‚Äù).

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names.

- [x] Miltestone 1 - User model, view, controller setup and basic sign in
- [x] Miltestone 2 - Event model, view, controller setup
- [x] Miltestone 3 - Attendance model, view, controller setup
